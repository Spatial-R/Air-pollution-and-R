Air-pollution-and-R
===================

This is my report in the seventh R meeting in Shanghai, China.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

It is my great honor to give a short report in the R meeting. My topic is about the way to get the air pollution data in China using the R package([XML](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html) and [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html) and then do some analysis  based on server R packages such as openair, sp and ggplot.
